## Multi-Dimensional Data Viewer 

Multi-Dimensional Data Viewer is an app to quickly view tabular data where some of the columns
represent dimensions and some of the columns represent metrics.

It produces a tab for each metric containing subplots which represent various values of different dimensions.

Finally, there is a "DATA" tab, whereby you can quickly filter along dimensions.
